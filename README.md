Voodoo iOS Founding Engineer Test - Project Summary

Project Overview:

The application developed focuses on sharing 'real' pictures with close friends and maintaining a shared collection of memories. The core feature set allows users to send pictures to unlock chat functionalities, promoting genuine interaction. The chat locks after 24 hours without a photo, encouraging regular engagement.

Technical Decisions and Approaches:

- Implemented a custom conversation feed blurred when last photo sent was over 24 hours ago.
- Ensured seamless user experience by allowing photos to be selected with a long press and subsequent selections with simple taps.
- Introduced a footer component visible during photo selection for sharing images in conversations.
- Utilized state management to track selected photos and user interactions.

UI/UX Considerations:

- While the primary focus was on product functionality, considerations were made for an intuitive UI.
- Interactions were designed to be simple yet engaging, fostering a photo-centric chat experience.
- Efforts were made to ensure the interface was visually appealing, with attention to selection indicators and navigation clarity.

Potential Future Features:

- Utilize NLP to recognize when users mention specific moments in conversations, surfacing relevant memories.
- Detect organizational patterns for events, creating albums and reminders to capture photos during the event.

Reflections:

- Although the current UI/UX serves the product concept, there is room for improvement to enhance user delight.
- The product concept is compelling, emphasizing authentic sharing and communication among close friends.

Thank you for considering this submission. I look forward to any feedback and the opportunity to discuss the project further.
