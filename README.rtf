\f0\fs24 \cf0 Voodoo iOS Founding Engineer Test - Project Summary\
\

\f1\b\fs26 Project Overview:
\f0\b0\fs24 \
\
The application developed focuses on sharing 'real' pictures with close friends and maintaining a shared collection of memories. The core feature set allows users to send pictures to unlock chat functionalities, promoting genuine interaction. The chat locks after 24 hours without a photo, encouraging regular engagement.\
\

\f1\b Technical Decisions and Approaches:
\f0\b0 \
\
- Implemented a custom conversation feed blurred when last photo sent was over 24 hours ago.\
- Ensured seamless user experience by allowing photos to be selected with a long press and subsequent selections with simple taps.\
- Introduced a footer component visible during photo selection for sharing images in conversations.\
- Utilized state management to track selected photos and user interactions.\
\

\f1\b UI/UX Considerations:
\f0\b0 \
\
- While the primary focus was on product functionality, considerations were made for an intuitive UI.\
- Interactions were designed to be simple yet engaging, fostering a photo-centric chat experience.\
- Efforts were made to ensure the interface was visually appealing, with attention to selection indicators and navigation clarity.\
\

\f1\b Potential Future Features:
\f0\b0 \
\
- Utilize NLP to recognize when users mention specific moments in conversations, surfacing relevant memories.\
- Detect organizational patterns for events, creating albums and reminders to capture photos during the event.\
\

\f1\b Reflections:
\f0\b0 \
\
- Although the current UI/UX serves the product concept, there is room for improvement to enhance user delight.\
- The product concept is compelling, emphasizing authentic sharing and communication among close friends.\
